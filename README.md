Always multicast!

Since the Setup is [rather complex](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/installing-confluence-data-center-203603.html), we will start a preconfigured cluster,
that has already been setup. Meaning a preconfigured confluence-home and database-dump are used.

http://confluence-cluster-611-lb:50611/

port is versioned as well as network and container names!
