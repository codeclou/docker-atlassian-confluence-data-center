# Docker Atlassian Confluence Data Center

> Start an [Atlassian Confluence Data Center](https://de.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center) with Docker for local testing during plugin development.

It starts a PostgreSQL Database, several Confluence cluster nodes and Apache2 HTTPD as sticky session loadbalancer. The shared confluence-home is handled via a shared Docker volume. This is not meant to be used in production! The cluster is designed to not be persistent, meaning, once you shut it down, all data is lost. See it as the Data Center version of [`atlas-run-standalone`](https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/developer-tools/working-with-the-sdk/command-reference/atlas-run-standalone).

Please choose the Confluence version you want to run:

 * **⇨ [versions](https://github.com/codeclou/docker-atlassian-confluence-data-center/tree/master/versions/)**
 
&nbsp;

**Please Note:**

- :warning: **Since version 7.0.1 we use the official Atlassian Docker images and docker compose.**
  - Older versions can be found in [codeclou-archive/docker-atlassian-confluence-data-center](https://github.com/codeclou-archive/docker-atlassian-confluence-data-center)
- We do not provide support. If you have questions on how to run Confluence and/or Confluence Data Center, please ask in the
  [Atlassian Community](https://community.atlassian.com/).
