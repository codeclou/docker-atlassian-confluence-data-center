# docker-atlassian-confluence-data-center

Start an [Atlassian Confluence® Data Center](https://de.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center) with Docker for local testing during plugin development.
It starts a PostgreSQL Database, several Confluence® cluster nodes and Apache2 HTTPD as sticky session loadbalancer. The shared confluence-home is handled via a shared Docker volume. This is not meant to be used in production!
